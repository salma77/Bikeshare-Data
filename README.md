Bikeshare-Data

This project is part of a Data Analysis program that I am enrolled in, it's goal is to practice using python, specifically pandas and numpy
It uses data from a bikesharing app to provide the user with segments of this data customized to the users demands. The data consists of bikesharing information from 3 states, it includes things like the Start and End stations, the sharer's age, etc. The user should choose a state, a month and a day of the week to provide the data for. The displayed data includes: most frequent times of travel, most popular stations, the total and average trips duration, some statistics on bikeshare users and at last provides some raw data the amount of which the user specifies.
